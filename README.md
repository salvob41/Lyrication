# Lyrication
This project uses [billboard](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts) and [lyricwikia](https://github.com/enricobacis/lyricwikia).
 So you need the following packages installed with `pip` 
 
 ```
 pip install billboard.py
 pip install lyricwikia
 ```
 
This project wants to find a correlation between the top hits in the history and their lyrics.
